Android 12.0+ Target Version Issue
This error occurs when the Target Android Version is set to Android 12.0 with 'LocalNotifications' installed in the Android project.

Error from IDE:
'/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/xbuild/Xamarin/Android/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets(3,3): Error MSB6006: "java" exited with code 1. (MSB6006)'

Error from Console (Log verbosity: Detailed):
'android:exported needs to be explicitly specified for element <service#crc641bad354f4bef34d5.LNFirebaseMessagingService>. Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported` when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined. See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#exported for details.

Safer component exporting
If your app targets Android 12 or higher and contains activities, services, or broadcast receivers that use intent filters, you must explicitly declare the android:exported attribute for these app components.

Warning: If an activity, service, or broadcast receiver uses intent filters and doesn't have an explicitly-declared value for android:exported, your app can't be installed on a device that runs Android 12 or higher.
If the app component includes the LAUNCHER category, set android:exported to true. In most other cases, set android:exported to false.

Workaround:
* [BroadcastReceiver] --> [BroadcastReceiver(Exported = true)]
* [Service]           --> [Service(Exported = true)]
